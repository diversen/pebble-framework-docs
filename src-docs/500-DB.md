The `Pebble\DB` class should work with any database, but in this documentation we will stick with a MySQL database. It is also the only database that has a `schema` containing tables for `Pebble\Auth`, `Pebble\ACL`, and `Pebble\ACLRole`. For instruction on running MySQL you may refer to [Setup MySQL](index#docker-mysql) 

### Usage

Now we can test all methods. Most of these methods should be self-explanatory. 

<!-- include: examples/database/index.php -->

You may run the example:

    php -S localhost:8000 -t examples/database

And then visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
