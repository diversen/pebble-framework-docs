The `Pebble\DB` class should work with any database, but in this documentation 
we will stick with the MySQL database. If you don't have access to a MySQL database, 
then it is quite easy to run a docker MySQL server instance. 

### Docker MySQL

Install (run) a MySQL image that will work:

    docker run -p 3306:3306 --name mysql-server -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:5.7

List containers 

    docker container ls

Stop container (mysql-server):

    docker stop mysql-server

Start container (mysql-server) again:

    docker start mysql-server

Remove container (you will need to run the 'run' command again):

    docker rm mysql-server

### Connect

The default `config/DB.php` file should work with above docker settings, where 
the username is `root` and the password is `password`.

Check your database settings: 

<!-- include: config-locale/DB.php -->

Create the database if it does not exist:  

    ./cli.sh db --server-connect
    CREATE DATABASE `pebble`;

### Test

Now we can test all methods. Most of these methods should be self-explanatory. 

<!-- include: examples/database/index.php -->

You may run the example:

    php -S localhost:8000 -t examples/database

And then visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
