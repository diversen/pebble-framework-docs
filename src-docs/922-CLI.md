The pebble frameworks uses the `diversen/minimal-cli-framework` for making command line programs. 

    composer require diversen/minimal-cli-framework

### Example sub-command

Create a command: 

<!-- include: src/CliTestCommand.php -->

### Create CLI program

There is few built-in commands that you can use right away. 

Let's add the  above command to a CLI program with some commands that are included
with the `pebble-framework`. 

<!-- include: examples/cli/index.php -->

Run the command, e.g: 

    php examples/cli/index.php filesize --pretty ./README.md

Same as:

    php examples/cli/index.php filesize --pr ./README.md

Get help about the command: 

    php examples/cli/index.php filesize -h

Use the built-in DB command (connect to the database):

    php examples/cli/index.php db --connect
