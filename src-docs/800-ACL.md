An access control list (ACL) is a list of rules that specifies which users or systems 
are granted or denied access to a particular object or system resource.

The ACL class extends the Auth class so it is possible to use all public
methods found in the Auth class. 

An ACL right consist of an `entity`, `entity_id`, `right`, and `auth_id`. 
The `entity` could be a database table named  **note**. The `entity_id` could be the primary ID
of the note table. The `right` could be `read` or `write`, and the `auth_id` is probably a 
logged in user's `auth_id`.   

Let's test the ACL object in a controller. 

<!-- include: src/ACLTestController.php -->

We execute this controller in our `index.php` file: 

<!-- include: examples/acl/index.php -->

Run this example using:

    php -S localhost:8000 -t examples/acl

You can now add the access right on [http://localhost:8000/rights/add](http://localhost:8000/rights/add)

You can remove it on [http://localhost:8000/rights/remove](http://localhost:8000/rights/remove)

If the right exists then you may visit [http://localhost:8000/note/read/42](http://localhost:8000/note/read/42)

But you can never visit [http://localhost:8000/note/read/41](http://localhost:8000/note/read/41)
(this ID can not be set)
